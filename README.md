## Own Module for Server Management Course in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences


The purpose of this module is to provide some commonly used programs easily on a live USB Linux machine.


Just open a terminal window, and type the following commands:


```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paul-Matt/ohjelma_koodit/master/run.sh
bash run.sh
```
