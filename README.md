## Own Module for Server Management Course autumn 2020 in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences


The purpose of this module is to provide some commonly used programs easily on a live USB Linux machine.


Just open a terminal window, and type the following commands:


```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paul-Matt/ohjelma_koodit/master/run.sh
bash run.sh
```

Disclaimer: This was added later on, so might not be 100% accurate, but as far as I can remember this module has been tested to work on Xubuntu 18.04. Other versions might not work.
